Excellent question. This is a very powerful and increasingly popular model for creators and experts who want to build a deep, monetizable knowledge asset rather than just a chronological blog.
Let's break down your idea.
What is this system called?
This system is most accurately called a Digital Garden.
A Digital Garden is a knowledge management philosophy that moves away from the time-based, linear structure of a traditional blog and instead focuses on creating an interconnected, ever-evolving network of ideas.
Here's why that term fits perfectly:
Non-Collaborative & Curated: Unlike a public wiki (like Wikipedia), a digital garden is tended by a single "gardener" (you, the admin). You control the content, ensuring its quality and consistency.
Interlinked Knowledge: The core feature is dense linking between "notes" or pages. A note on "Mitochondria" links to "Autophagy," which links back to "Mitochondria" and also to "Intermittent Fasting."
Ideas Grow Over Time: Notes can be in various stages—from "seedlings" (brief ideas) to "evergreen" (fully developed, foundational content).
Blog as the Guided Tour: Your blog posts act as the "garden paths." They take a reader on a narrative journey through a specific part of your garden, connecting several established wiki pages to provide practical, actionable advice. The blog is the "how-to," and the wiki is the "why."
You are essentially proposing a two-tier content model built on Digital Garden principles:
The Blog (Top of Funnel): Free, accessible, practical articles that solve immediate problems and demonstrate your expertise. They are rich with links pointing into the wiki.
The Wiki/Digital Garden (Premium Asset): The paid, in-depth knowledge base. This is the systematized, foundational science that backs up everything you say. It's the core value proposition for subscribers.
Can this system and paywall be done with Git publishing without a database?
Yes, absolutely. This is a perfect use case for a modern web architecture called the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup), which excels at creating high-performance, secure sites without relying on a traditional server-side backend or database that you have to manage yourself.
Here is how the entire system would work, piece by piece:
1. Content Management (The "Git Publishing" part)
Source of Truth: All your content—both blog posts and wiki pages—lives as simple Markdown (.md) files in your Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).
Organization: You would structure your folders logically, for example:
/content/blog/2024-07-post-about-sleep.md
/content/wiki/mitochondria.md
/content/wiki/vitamin-k2.md
Metadata: Inside each Markdown file, you use "frontmatter" (a small block of YAML at the top) to define its properties. This is where you'd flag premium content.

    - "nad+"

    ## What are Mitochondria?
    Mitochondria are organelles...
    2. The Build Process (The "Static Site Generator")
    You use a Static Site Generator (SSG) like Next.js, Astro, or Hugo.
    During the build process (which runs whenever you push changes to Git), the SSG reads all your Markdown files.
    It intelligently builds all the connections:
    It sees a [[mitochondria]] link in a blog post and automatically creates the correct URL.
    Crucially, it can also build the backlinks: when building the mitochondria.md page, it scans all other files to find any that link to it, and automatically generates the "Mentioned In" section.
    The final output is a complete website made of pre-built, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. There is no database.
    3. The Paywall Structure (The "Magic" without a Database)
    This is the key part. You handle authentication and subscriptions not with your own database, but through a third-party API service.
    The Service: You use a service like Memberstack, Outseta, or directly with Stripe Customer Portal. These services manage your users, subscriptions, and payments for you.
    The Workflow:
    Your static site includes a small snippet of JavaScript from your chosen service.
    When a non-subscribed user tries to view a page marked with premium: true, the JavaScript hides the content and shows a "Subscribe" button.
    Clicking "Subscribe" sends the user to a secure payment page hosted by the service (e.g., Stripe Checkout).
    After successful payment, the service creates a user account and sets a secure cookie or token in their browser.
    When the user returns to your site, the JavaScript snippet detects this token, verifies with the service that they have an active subscription, and "unlocks" the premium content right in their browser.
    The premium content is technically present in the static HTML file, but it's hidden by default and only revealed for authenticated users.
    Pros and Cons of this Git-Based Approach
    Pros (Why it's a great idea):
    Blazing Fast Performance: Static sites are served directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This makes them incredibly fast, which is great for user experience and SEO.
    Enhanced Security: With no database to manage, the primary attack vectors for hackers (like SQL injection) are eliminated.
    Incredible Scalability: Your site can handle huge traffic spikes with no performance degradation because it's just serving simple files.
    Excellent Developer Experience: Writing in Markdown and managing content through Git is a clean, powerful workflow.
    Lower Cost: Static hosting is extremely cheap or often free (on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages). Your main cost is the monthly fee for the subscription management service.
    Cons (What to be aware of):
    Client-Side Gating: The simplest form of paywall is client-side (hiding/showing with JavaScript). A tech-savvy user could potentially view the source code to see the premium content. For a knowledge wiki, this is often an acceptable risk, but for highly sensitive data, more advanced server-side gating would be needed (which is still possible in a Jamstack model via serverless functions).
    Dependency on Third-Party Services: Your entire monetization model is tied to the subscription service you choose. If they go down, your login/payment system goes down.
    Initial Technical Setup: While simpler than managing a full backend, it requires a developer to set up the static site generator, the bi-directional linking logic, and integrate the subscription service's JavaScript. It's not a "no-code" solution.
