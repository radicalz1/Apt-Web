Final Verdict:
The best path forward for your app is to:
Continue hosting your frontend on Vercel.
Use Supabase as your all-in-one backend for the database, authentication, and APIs.
Refactor your AuthContext and data-handling pages (QuestionnairePage, SubmissionsPage) to use the Supabase client library instead of localStorage.

currently I have this codebase deployed on vercel, auto redeploy every github update. I want to use mock data when modifying files and testing here, but when I push this into github and redeployed on vercel, I want it to automatically use live supabase data. This kind of automation can it be done?

Of course! This is an excellent and very common professional workflow.
Yes, this automation is not only possible but is a standard best practice for modern web development, and it's one of the core strengths of platforms like Vercel.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works and how you would set it up.
The Core Concept: Environment Variables
The magic behind this automation is Environment Variables. These are variables that are set outside of your application's code, in the environment where your code is running (i.e., on your local computer or on Vercel's servers).
On your local machine: You'll use a file named .env.local to store your mock data connection strings or API keys. This file is never committed to GitHub for security reasons.
On Vercel: You'll use Vercel's dashboard to securely store your live Supabase API keys. When Vercel builds and deploys your application, it automatically injects these live keys into the environment.
Your code will be written to simply read these variables, completely unaware of whether it's running locally or on Vercel. This allows the same codebase to connect to mock data locally and live data in production without any changes.
Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Here is the exact plan to transition your application from its current localStorage-based system to a professional, environment-aware Supabase setup.
Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials
Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
In the left sidebar, click on Project Settings (the gear icon).
Click on API.
You will find two crucial pieces of information you need:
Project URL: It will look like https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
Project API Keys -> anon public key: This is your safe, public-facing key. It will be a long string of characters.
Step 2: Configure Vercel with Live Keys
Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel.
Click on the Settings tab.
In the left menu, click on Environment Variables.
Add two new variables for your Production environment:
Key: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: Paste your Project URL from Supabase.
Key: VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: Paste your anon public key from Supabase.
Vercel will securely store these and make them available to your application whenever it's deployed.
Step 3: Set Up Your Local Mock Environment
In the root of your project, create a new file named .env.local.
Add the following lines to it. These can be placeholder values since your local logic will use mock data, but it prepares your code to expect these variables.
code
Code
# .env.local - For local development
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="http://localhost:54321"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-mock-anon-key"
Crucially, add .env.local to your .gitignore file to ensure you never accidentally commit it to GitHub.
code
Code
# .gitignore
...
.env.local
Step 4: Implement the Supabase Client
To make connecting to Supabase clean, create a utility file.
Create a new file at src/lib/supabaseClient.ts (or utils/supabase.ts).
Add the following code. This single piece of code will automatically use the correct keys depending on the environment.
code
TypeScript
// src/lib/supabaseClient.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// These variables will be read from .env.local on your computer,
// and from Vercel's environment variables when deployed.
const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL!
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
(Note: We use VITE_ as a prefix because you are using Vite as your build tool, which is standard for this kind of setup).
Step 5: Refactor Your Code to Use Supabase
Now, you'll update your components to use this new Supabase client instead of localStorage. This is the most significant part of the change.
Example: Refactoring AuthContext.tsx
code
TypeScript
// A simplified example of what your new AuthContext might look like
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabaseClient.ts';

// ...

const login = async (email: string, pass: string) => {
  setLoading(true);
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });
  if (error) {
    setLoading(false);
    throw error;
  }
  // Supabase handles the session, you just need to get the user
  setUser(data.user);
  setLoading(false);
  navigate('/dashboard');
};

const signup = async (name: string, email: string, pass: string) => {
  setLoading(true);
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: { data: { full_name: name } } // Add metadata
  });
  if (error) {
    setLoading(false);
    throw error;
  }
  setUser(data.user);
  setLoading(false);
  navigate('/questionnaire');
};

const logout = async () => {
  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  setUser(null);
  navigate('/');
};

// ...
Example: Refactoring QuestionnairePage.tsx
Your handleSubmit function would change from saving to localStorage to saving to a Supabase table.
code
TypeScript
// A simplified example for handleSubmit in QuestionnairePage.tsx

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  addToast('Submitting your assessment...', 'info');

  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  const submissionData = {
    // id will be auto-generated by Supabase
    user_id: user?.id, // Link submission to the logged-in user
    submitted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    form_data: formData // The main JSON object of answers
  };

  // Insert the data into a 'submissions' table in Supabase
  const { error } = await supabase.from('submissions').insert([submissionData]);

  if (error) {
    console.error("Error saving submission to Supabase", error);
    addToast('Error saving submission.', 'error');
    setIsSubmitting(false);
    return;
  }

  // ... (rest of your logic for WhatsApp, navigation, etc.)
};
Summary of the Workflow
Locally: When you run npm run dev, your app starts. The supabaseClient.ts file reads the mock keys from your .env.local file. Your app connects to your local mock setup.
Push to GitHub: You commit your code (without the .env.local file) and push it to GitHub.
Deploy on Vercel: Vercel detects the push and starts a new deployment. During the build process, it injects the live VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY you configured in its dashboard.
Live: The newly deployed version of your app now uses those live keys, and the supabaseClient.ts file automatically connects to your live Supabase database.
This is a robust, secure, and fully automated system that cleanly separates your development and production environments.
